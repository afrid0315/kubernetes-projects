Init Containers
In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD’s lifecycle. For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times. The process running in the log agent container is expected to stay alive as long as the web application is running. If any of them fails, the POD restarts.

 

But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container. For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application. That is a task that will be run only one time when the pod is first created. Or a process that waits for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. That’s where initContainers comes in.

 

An initContainer is configured in a pod like all other containers, except that it is specified inside a initContainers section, like this:

 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone <some-repository-that-will-be-used-by-application> ;']
 

When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts.

You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-containers pod. In that case, each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.

If any of the initContainers fail to complete, Kubernetes restarts the Pod repeatedly until the Init Container succeeds.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done;']

# Understanding the Differences Between Sidecar and Co-located Containers in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit, often comprising multiple containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes. Within this context, two common patterns emerge: Sidecar containers and Co-located containers. While both reside within the same Pod, they serve distinct roles and have different lifecycle behaviors.

# Sidecar Containers
A Sidecar container is a secondary container that runs alongside the main application container within the same Pod. Its primary purpose is to enhance or extend the functionality of the main application without modifying its code. Common use cases include logging, monitoring, proxying, and data synchronization.

Starting with Kubernetes v1.29, sidecar containers are implemented as restartable init containers by setting restartPolicy: Always, and are placed under the initContainers field. This approach ensures that sidecar containers start before and are terminated after the main application containers and continue running throughout the Pod's lifecycle.

They can also be restarted independently if they exit unexpectedly. (kubernetes.io)

# Example: Application with a Logging Sidecar
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-logging-sidecar
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-logs
      emptyDir: {}
  initContainers:
    - name: log-shipper
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -F /opt/logs.txt']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /opt
      restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
    - name: main-app
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo "logging" >> /opt/logs.txt; sleep 1; done']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-logs
          mountPath: /opt
```

In this example, the log-shipper sidecar container tails the log file generated by the main-app container. The shared volume shared-logs facilitates communication between the two containers.

# Co-located Containers
Co-located containers refer to multiple containers running within the same Pod that collaborate to achieve a common goal. That is the new term now used to distinguish what was previously referred to as a sidecar before the Kubernetes v1.29 updates. Unlike sidecar containers, co-located containers often share equal responsibility in the application's functionality. They can start and stop independently and may not have a defined startup order.

# Example: Web Server with Content Generator
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server-with-helper
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: shared-content
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: content-generator
      image: busybox
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo " Hello from Helper! " > /output/index.html && sleep 3600']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-content
          mountPath: /output
    - name: web-server
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: shared-content
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Here, the content-generator container creates an HTML file that the web-server container serves using NGINX. Both containers are integral to the application's functionality and operate collaboratively.

# Key Differences

| Feature	| Sidecar Container	| Co-located Container |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| Primary Role	| Enhance or extend main application functionality	 | Collaborate equally in application logic |
| Startup Order | Starts before main container (if using initContainers) |	No defined startup order |
| Lifecycle |	Runs alongside main container; can be restarted independently	| Independent lifecycle |
| Typical Use Cases	| Logging, monitoring, proxying, data synchronization	| Multi-process applications, helpers |
| Implementation (Post v1.29)	| Defined as initContainer with restartPolicy: Always	| Defined in containers field | 

# Conclusion
Understanding the distinction between sidecar and co-located containers is crucial for designing effective Kubernetes applications. With the introduction of native sidecar support in Kubernetes v1.29, implementing sidecar containers has become more streamlined, offering better control over startup order and lifecycle management. Choosing the appropriate pattern depends on the specific requirements and architecture of your application.
